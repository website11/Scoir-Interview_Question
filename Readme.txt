How-To:

1. To execute the program through command prompt/terminal, first install the "pandas" module through pip
2. Navigate to the folder where the .py is saved and run it with "python Pandas-Approach-Working.py"

The main file is Pandas-Approach-Working.py. The other .py files are other methods and attempts that I tried (but did not finish) as I did not find
it the most efficient way to finish the problem. The test excel file that I used is in names.csv

Assumptions:
I worked on this problem making a couple of assumptions that actually complicated the question a bit more than I would have liked. I assumed that I would
want to demonstrate my understanding of certain data structures and their usage, but ultimately found that working in python actually made a lot of this
reduntant. 
I ultimately decided that the main purpose of this question should be to show an efficient way of approaching it (even if it does not demonstrate as much about certain
code design strucutures and principles). 

I would like to request that during the interview, I can explain all my different attempts/approaches as it will give a better overall understanding of my 
thought process into this problem (which will hopefully help carry the conversation).

Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you soon!
